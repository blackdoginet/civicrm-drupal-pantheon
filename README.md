# CiviCRM/Drupal on Pantheon
A minimally-patched CiviCRM for Drupal on Pantheon platform.

The idea is that you spin up a fresh Pantheon Drupal 7 site at http://getpantheon.com. Then upload the civicrm folder into sites/all/modules. Login to your Drupal site with Administrator level permissions. Then point your browser to the install script such as:

```
http://<your_drupal_home>/sites/all/modules/civicrm/install/index.php
```

Check civicrm-version.php to see what version has been patched. We'll start applying tags to help with this soon.
